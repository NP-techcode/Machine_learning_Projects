# Capstone Project - Notes

**Deliverables:**

* Github repository
* Blog post directed towards a technical audience


**Outline:**

* Define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions
* Analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.
* Implement your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and post-processing steps along the way
* Collect results about your findings, visualize significant quantities, validate/justify your results, and make any concluding remarks about whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.
* Construct a blog post to document all of the steps from start to finish of your project, or deploy results in a web application.



**Resources:**

* [Examples, templates](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/capstone)


**Key points of the project:**

1. Project's domain background - field of research where the project is derived
2. A problem statement - problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined.
3. The datasets and inputs - data or inputs being used for the problem
4. A solution statement - solution proposed for the problem given
5. A benchmark model - some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solutions to
6. A set of evaluation metrics - functional representations for how the solution can be measured
7. Outline of the project design - how the solution will be developed and results obtained.

## Storyline

* Why and where TS forecasting is important. What has changed to Time Series (Sources); Before: Individual models, Now: hundreds of models
* M4 as paradigm shift
* Since then: New methods
* Problems: Required size of dataset; Computational complexity; New developed methods or untested methods.
